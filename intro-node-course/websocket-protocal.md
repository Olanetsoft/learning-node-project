### The WebSocket Protocal

 - Allows for full-duplex communication meaning the communication is bi-directional, clients can sends the server and server can sends the client.
 - Persistent connection between client and server
 - Different then HTTP, which is clients ask for request then the server would respond only.

#### Simple Example

Client 1 -> Sends Message 'Hello' to Server

Server gets message -> sends to message to any clinet that is connected to the server, in this case Client 2.

Client 2 displays the message to the in the browser
